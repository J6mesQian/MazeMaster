# MazeMaster
MazeMaster is a program designed to generate and solve mazes using various algorithms. It allows users to generate mazes using the backtracking algorithm and choose between BFS, DFS, and flood-fill to solve the mazes. The program also offers the option to play back the animation of the maze solving process at different speeds. In addition, users can store the generated and solved mazes to a file or view them in the console.
